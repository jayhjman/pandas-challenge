# Py City Schools

- **_Py City Schools_** - A [Juypter Notebook](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb) that analyzes the school and student records of the given district. The data provided will allow us to look at several factors which include student scores (reading and math), budgetary costs, school sizes, passing metrics, types of schools, scores by grades and top percentiles. We can summarize data in different ways and present some observations on what the data might be telling us.
